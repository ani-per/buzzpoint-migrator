# Buzzpoint Migrator

This tool ingests JSON packet files and QBJ game files into a SQLite database. The [`buzzpoints` app](https://github.com/JemCasey/buzzpoints) uses this SQLite database to build a web app that visualizes the data in a convenient form.

JSON packet files can be generated via these packet parsers:

* [QBReader Packet Parser](https://quizbowlreader.com/yapp.html)
* [Yet Another Packet Parser (YAPP)](https://www.qbreader.org/tools/packet-parser/)

QBJ files are generated by [MODAQ](https://github.com/alopezlago/MODAQ).

## Getting Started

### Preparation

1. Clone this repository via SSH, HTTPS, or downloading as a zip.
2. Install [`Node.js` and `npm`](https://nodejs.org/en/download) on your system if they're not already installed.
   * `Node.js` version `22.12.0` is the recommended version. `better-sqlite3` has some issues with `Node.js` version `24.*` that you might run into.
3. Open a bash shell (e.g. Terminal), go to the root directory, and run `npm install`.
   * This command will install all the necessary libraries.

### File Structure

1. Create a directory called `data` in the root directory of the project.
2. Inside `data`, create folders called `question_sets` and `tournaments`.
3. In `question_sets`, add folders for each of the question sets you'd like to add to the database.
   * In each question set folder, add an `index.json` file in the following style:

     ```json
     {
         "name": "2023 Chicago Open",
         "slug": "2023-chicago-open",
         "difficulty": "Open",
         "metadataStyle": 1,
         "format": "powers",
         "bonuses": true
     }
     ```

   * [Acceptable values for `metadataStyle`](#metadata-styles) are listed below. `1` is default (and probably what you need).
     * `metadataStyle` is required if you'd like the `questions` table to populate with category and author data.
     * You can modify the code in [`metadata-utils.js`](/metadata-utils.js) if you need a custom format.
   * [Acceptable values for `format`](#question-set-formats) are listed below. `powers` is default.
   * If the set doesn't have bonuses, set `bonuses` to `false`.
4. In each subfolder of `question sets`, add a folder called `editions`.
   Each subfolder in `editions` corresponds to a version of the question set.
   Each `editions` subfolder should have an `index.json` file with properties `name`, `slug`, and `date`.
   * For instance, if 2023 Chicago Open has an edition that was played on August 05, 2023 at a , create a subfolder in `editions` called `2023-08-05` [^1]:

     ```json
     {
         "name": "08/05/2023",
         "slug": "2023-08-05",
         "date": "2023-08-05"
     }
     ```

5. In each subfolder of `editions`, add a `packet_files` subfolder containing the MODAQ packet json files for that version of the question set.
6. In your `data/tournaments` folder, add folders for each of the tournaments that you'd like to add to the database.
   In each tournament folder, add an `index.json` file in the following format:

   ```json
   {
       "name": "2023 Chicago Open",
       "slug": "2023-chicago-open",
       "set": "2023 Chicago Open",
       "edition": "08/05/2023",
       "location": "Northwestern University",
       "level": "Open",
       "start_date": "2023-08-05",
       "end_date": "2023-08-05",
       "rounds_to_exclude_from_individual_stats": [
           16,
           17
       ]
   }
   ```

   * The `edition` field should match the `name` field of the `index.json` of the corresponding question set edition.

7. In each tournament folder, add a folder called `game_files` and insert the tournament's QBJ files there.
   * Each QBJ filename should start with the string `Round_`, then the round number, then an underscore, e.g. `Round_1_Team_One_Team_Two.qbj`.
8. Your `data` subfolder should now be structured like this:

   ```text
   .
   |-- question_sets
   |   |-- 2023_Chicago_Open
   |   |   |-- editions
   |   |       |-- 2023-08-05
   |   |           |-- packet_files
   |   |               `-- Packet_1.json
   |   |               `-- Packet_2.json
   |   |               `-- ...
   |   |           `-- index.json
   |   |   `-- index.json
   |-- tournaments
       |-- 2023_Chicago_Open
       |   `-- game_files
   |   |       `-- Round_1_X_Team_One_Team_Two.qbj
   |   |       `-- Round_2_X_Team_Three_Team_Four.qbj
   |   |       `-- ...
       |   `-- index.json
   ```

9. Return to the bash shell and run `npm run initDB`.
   * This command will build the database and store it as `database.db`.

10. Now you can copy the `database.db` to the `data` folder of your local deployment of the [`buzzpoints`](https://github.com/JemCasey/buzzpoints) app.

## Credits

Thanks to Anderson Wang and Geoffrey Wu for their feedback on the tool, and to Geoffrey for letting me steal [`subcat-to-cat.json` from his packet parser](https://github.com/qbreader/packet-parser/blob/main/modules/subcat-to-cat.json).

[^1]: The `name` field doesn't have to correspond to a certain date, you can call it whatever you want as long as the `edition` of any corresponding tournament matches it. The slug doesn't matter either.
